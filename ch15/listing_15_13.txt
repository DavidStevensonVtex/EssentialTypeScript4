Listing 15-13. Starting the Development Web Server 

npx webpack serve 


$ npx webpack serve 
[webpack-cli] Unable to load '@webpack-cli/serve' command
[webpack-cli] TypeError: options.forEach is not a function

https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/1870

Here is the issue in the source project:
webpack/webpack-cli#2990

I can confirm bumping it to 4.9.0 appears to work
(modify version in package.json)

npm install
