Listing 10-22. Adding Properties with Different Types in the index.ts File in the src Folder

type Person = {
    id:   string,
    name: string,
    city: string,
    contact: number
} ;

type Employee = {
    id: string,
    company: string,
    dept: string,
    contact: string
} ;

type EmployedPerson = Person & Employee ;

let typeTest = ({} as EmployedPerson).contact ;

Book says the index.d.ts file says the following type for the contact property in the intersection.

Actual index.d.ts now:

declare let typeTest: never;
